# javascript and classes 
<!-- JavaScript has a mechanism called "classes," introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript's class syntax is essentially a syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model. Under the hood, classes in JavaScript are still based on prototypes. -->
<!-- It is primarily a prototype based language -->
<!-- oop is programming paradigm (means your structure of writing code) -->

## Object 
<!-- - collection of properties(variables etc) and methods(functions etc) -->

## why use oop 
<!-- - Object-oriented programming (OOP) provides modularity, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitate code organization, reuse, and maintenance in software development. -->

## parts of oop 
<!-- object literal (matlab ye literally ek object hai) -->

- Constructor function <!-- - A constructor function in JavaScript is a special function used to create and initialize objects of a specific type(matlab yeh hamesha humein ek nayi copy de deta hai). When invoked with the `new` keyword, it creates a new instance and sets the `this` keyword to refer to that instance. Constructor functions are commonly used to define blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and behaviors. -->
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new,this)

## 4 pillars of oop

<!-- 1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit. Example: A `Car` object encapsulates properties like `speed` and methods like `accelerate()` and `brake()`.

2. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones. Example: A `SUV` class can inherit from a `Car` class, gaining its properties and methods while adding specific features like `fourWheelDrive`.

3. **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types can be treated interchangeably. Example: Both a `Car` and a `Motorcycle` can have a `drive()` method, allowing them to be used interchangeably in a function expecting a generic `Vehicle`.

4. **Abstraction**: Representing essential features of an object while hiding its complexities. Example: A `Shape` class abstracts common properties and methods shared by different shapes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`, such as `area()` and `perimeter()`. -->
