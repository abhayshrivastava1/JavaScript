Javascript is a 

1 synchronus - (line by line coe=de execute hoga) (default)
2 single threaded - (ek hi thread par sab kuch execute hoga, but js always runs in a runtime environment whether of node or browser) (default)

Execution Context - execute one line of code at a time (each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing)

Blocking Code -> Block the flow of program -> Read file sync 
used during data entry  

Non Blocking Code -> Does not block execution -> Read file async 
can be used when we can do multiple work at a single time

Both methods have their own use cases
